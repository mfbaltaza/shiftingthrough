# shiftingthrough
This it's a little project in which we got to deal with the shiftKey event, just like it's used on sites like Gmail.


I struggled here actually, it was late though 5 am to be exact. But in this little exercise we are just dealing with a little functionality that might be helpful for future projects. So ye, we got it done.

I got sick so I wasn't coding, working out or doing nothing for a few days. Just recovering, this it's good for the get going. I want to go far, I need to keep pushing it.
